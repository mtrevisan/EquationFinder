 * Median Absolute error

 * It is less sensitive to outliers than mean-based metrics. Therefore, itâ€™s a good choice for data that is not sparse at all, where we
 * have very few or no zeros and lots of non-zero values. In such cases, we might want to focus on the typical error (as given by the
 * median) rather than being influenced by a few large errors (which would affect the mean).
